👋 Hi, I’m @shivako-IA
👀 I’m interested in learning to code.
🌱 I’m currently learning to become a skilled programmer and create cool, epic projects that bring joy to users and contribute to the world.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on challenging projects that push my skills and explore new technologies.
📫 How to reach me: You can find me on GitHub as @shivako-IA.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: My name is Andres, but I go by Ako, and "Shivako" is inspired by the Shiva Shakti mythology, symbolizing transcendence and existence. Something fun about me is that I feel like Neo from The Matrix when diving into the alien world of programming - it's a world within a world that feels wonderfully strange. 🌟
